3. Minimize button - Right now it appears on a separate bar, but unfortunately, that looks like a search bar.  What about moving it elsewhere so it's not a searchbar.  Also after minimizing, we want the user to know to expand.  So maybe alternate use of + and - maybe?

4.  The map is looking very beautiful I must say.  We could add a + and - on the circle itself, so people can increase/decrease the radius area of the circle automatically.  

6. Radio buttons on the Select All Cats:  Too many squares at the moment.
- Maybe a smaller font for the subcats? Also, I am thinking if we can take out the outline for the radio button so it doesn't look glary?  And a square for the cat and a circle for the subcat maybe?  Will leave it to you.

7.  Maybe we can remove the labels "Address" and "Call" and just have the icons - they are self-explanatory and beautiful at the same time will give space for more details?


10. In the business card, add the cat/subcat in addition to the provider details, below or something, so the user has context.

11. green map marker make it movable on the screen.
